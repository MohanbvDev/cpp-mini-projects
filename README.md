# C++ Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple and beginner-friendly C++ mini projects I created while learning programming. Each folder represents a small, self-contained console-based program.

##  Projects Included

1. [Hello World](01-hello-world/)  
   My first C++ program — prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Also my first activity on GitHub.

- This is an ongoing learning repo, I’ll keep adding new mini-projects as I explore more C++.
