# Hello World (C++)

This is my first C++ program that prints `"Hello, World!"` to the console (or terminal wondow).

## File
- `helloworld.cpp`

## About This Project
This is my **first project** and also my **first activity on GitHub**.

I know it's simple but every programmer has to do it.
I'm excited to learn more, build more projects, and keep improving. 

##  How to Run

1. Compile:
   ```bash
   g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld\

2. Run:
  ```bash
  ./helloworld
```

## Output 
You must get the output like this: Hello, World!
